        <p>When it comes to spotting a bootleg NBA Jersey, it's important to understand that there has been many different jersey suppliers throughout
            the time the NBA has been around (Examples: Champion, Nike, Reebok, Adidas, etc). The image examples provided below will be using using the 
            Adidas-tailored Swingman jerseys they've made from 2010 to 2014, but the same information regarding to what out to watch for will still apply when looking
            to purchase an NBA jersey from an online site like eBay. The Jordan jersey above is actually a fake that's surprinsingly been well put together. What makes it a fake?
            I will explain how below.

        <p>One of the first things you need to look out for is seeing how the stitching is done. One obvious sign is looking out for how the knockoff Jerseys 
            will tend to have thread that connects the letters together. This will be seen on the inside of the jersey, but will be noticeable on the outside, specifically around 
            the team's name, along with the player's name on the back.
                </p>

         <p>Another example of easy to spot knockoffs is looking at the jock tag that do appear on the bottom right of the jersey. They tend to be replicated
            decently, but a closer look can help to determine if you are looking at a real vs a fake. When looking at the "Player ID" that appears at the bottom,
            you can notice how the real one has "PLAYER" and "ID" seperated, while the knockoff has them altogether.

            <P>On the jock tag, you can also notice how there's a "Length +2" tag, which are almost similar, though the font on the bootleg 
                jersey does differ compared to the offical one. It's a very minor difference, but there are other knockoffs that tend to have
                the NBA logo looking squished together as well, so be on a lookout for that.
            </P>

        <p>While I mentioned that was speficially talking about Adidas jerseys from 2010-2014, I feel it's important to also bring up how NBA 
            Jerseys from 2015 to today (Between Adidas and now Nike) both have transitioned from making stitched swingman jerseys to iron-pressed 
            NBA jerseys. So that means the Player's team, number and name will all be heat pressed, so no more stitching. The only cavet is that
            this mainly applies to the swingman jerseys, which are the more cheaper NBA jerseys you could purchased compared to an Authentic jersey, which
            retails for around $200 currently with the Nike Jerseys and is stitched on. 
         </p>
        <div><p>‎ </p></div>
         
         <p>The reason I'm bring this up is when purchasing any swingman jersey from 2015 onwards, it's important to look if the letters and numbers
            are either heat pressed or stitched on. If it's stitched and seller mentions that it's a swingman and not authentic jersey, then it's
        very much likely a knockoff.</p>
