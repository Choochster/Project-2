        <p>Hello there! Welcome to your one stop guide on how to spot knockoff NBA jerseys when purchasing one from online sites.

        <p>In the About tab, you will be shown some ways to of spotting knockoff NBA jerseys and how knowing what to look for will 
            help you save money and not deal with the cheap quality a knockoff will provide. My main goal for making this is to educate others
            about what they should be looking out for from purchasing an NBA jersey from other sites besides NBA's own official store. It will be 
            cheaper, but comes at the risk of running into bootleg jerseys that are most of the time bad quality and will charge you near the price
            of an official jersey.
